Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? Block elements take up the entire line; inline can be used with an existing element;
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? Mozilla: Elements that are relatively positioned remain in the normal flow of the document. In contrast, an element that is absolutely positioned is taken out of the flow; thus, other elements are positioned as if it did not exist. The absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., the nearest ancestor that is not static). If a positioned ancestor doesn't exist, it is positioned relative to the ICB (initial containing block — see also the W3C definition), which is the containing block of the document's root element.
    
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        - ???

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        3 block: <p> <section> <h1>
        2 inline: <span> <br>
        1 inline-block: <img> <button>
        
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        - The box model is design / display layout; where each html element has the following, starting from the center and moving out:
            (1) content
            (2) padding (contribute to total width)
            (3) border
            (4) margin
        - The issue is that CSS takes the element width you have given it, and then adds padding on top of this. This means a lot of planning has to happen to prevent elements from overlapping.
        - The fix is the "box-sizing: border-box" property that includes padding and borders in an element’s width
